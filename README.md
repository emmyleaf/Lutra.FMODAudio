# TODO: Rewrite this for Lutra!

*I suffer so you won't have to.*

The time has come. You're finally witnessing a high-level cross-platform C# library, which makes Monogame and FMOD best friends.

![header](/pics/ebites.png)

In case you came here and the only thing you got so far was that hilarious doge meme, [FMOD](http://fmod.org) is quite powerful cross-platform audio engine, which is pretty much the only hope to have any decent audio in Monogame. 

The catch is - FMOD is written in C++, and the only thing C# overlords have is a bare-bones C# wrapper. No tutorials, no setup guides. Only you and DllImport.

![send help](/pics/help.png)


That's why this library exists. It does the tough part for you, and provides basic high-level interface. 

Also note that even though the primary target of this library is Monogame, its sources will be very useful if you want to use FMOD in some other C#-based project.

## Setup

Initial setup is a little fiddly. Here's the thing - the FMOD license prohibits me from distributing their libraries in my Nuget package - so you have to download them yourself. But fear not, I've put together a detailed guide. With pictures.

### Preparations

Visit the [FMOD Download page](https://www.fmod.com/download) (accessing it requires registration), find the FMOD Studio API downloads and get APIs for Windows, Linux and Android. If you're going to set up all three, of course.

**NOTE: Current version of the library is made for FMOD v2.01.07. I really recommend getting it. Later versions will probably also work, but I have no guarantee.**


Windows API requires installation, Linux and Android don't. You can drop them near the Windows API just to have everything in one place.

### Windows & Linux

1. Open your DesktopGL or SharpDX Monogame project.
2. Install the NuGet package [ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio.Desktop](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio.Desktop/). Alternatively, you can plug repo as a submodule and reference projects directly.
3. Navigate to your FMOD Windows API installation. From there navigate to `\api\core\lib`. You will see two directories: `x64` and `x86`. Each one will contain this:

![setup2](/pics/setup2.png)


Out of all the files you'll need only `fmod.dll` from both `x86` and `x64` directories. Your Monogame project should already have `x86` and `x64` directories (if it doesn't - just create them). Copy corresponding versions of `fmod.dll` into them. You should end up with it looking like this:


![setup3](/pics/setup3.png)

Make sure dll files will be copied to the output directory:

![setup4](/pics/setup4.png)

4. Navigate to your FMOD Linux API installation. From there navigate to `\api\core\lib`. This time you will see four directories: 

![setup5](/pics/setup5.png)

You'll need only `x86` and `x86_64`.

Each directory contains this:

![setup6](/pics/setup6.png)

You will only need `libfmod` files - the ones without L. Copy fmod files from `x86` directory to `x86` directory of your project, and then copy files from `x86_64` to your `x64` directory. You'll end up with this:

![setup7](/pics/setup7.png)

*NOTE: If you're going for Linux-only build, you can exclude fmod.dll files.*

Again, make sure all the files you've just added will be copied to the output directory:

![setup4](/pics/setup4.png)

And that's it - you've gotten yourself cross-platform desktop FMOD! Dllmap for Linux is already done internally, no need to worry about that.

### Android

1. Open your Monogame Android project.
2. Install NuGet package [ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio.Android](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio.Android/). Alternatively, you can plug repo as a submodule and reference projects directly.
3. Create `libs` directory in the root of your project.
4. Navigate to your FMOD Android API installation. From there navigate to  `\api\core\lib`. You will see this:

![setup8](/pics/setup8.png)

5. Each folder contains `libfmod.so` and `libfmodL.so`. 
You need only `libfmod.so` from each directory. Copy everything except `.jar` file over to your `libs` directory. Don't lose this jar, tho. We'll need it later. You'll end up with this:

![setup9](/pics/setup9.png)

6. Select each `.so` file you've just copied, open their Properties and set their Build Action to `AndroidNativeLibrary`.

![setup10](/pics/setup10.png)

7. Create an **Android Bindings Project**.

   ![setup12](/pics/setup12.png)

   Remember that jar from earlier? Now you need to copy it into the Jars directory and make sure its Build Action is set to `EmbeddedJar`.

   ![setup13](/pics/setup13.png)

   Now reference Bindings project to your main Android project - and you're golden. 

   ![setup14](/pics/setup14.png)

   And yes. Whole separate project for a single file. Thanks, Xamarin. There is actually a way to do this without creating a Bindings project, but that's up to you to figure out. : - )

### Studio setup

FMOD Studio setup process is exactly the same, but you'll need to look into `studio` instead of `core` directories. **It's also extremely important that ALL your dlls and jar are taken form the same version. FMOD doesn't like version mixup. Foxes don't like version mixup. Nobody does.** 

If you still have questions, take a look at the [Demos project](/ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio.Demos).

## Playing some tunes!

So, after you've set everything up, it's time to bop some pops, as kids say these days.

1. Find a sound file and import it into the Content Pipeline.
2. Select the sound file and set its Build Action to Copy. 

![setup11](/pics/setup11.png)

3. Include the `ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio` namespace and paste the following code into your
Initialize() method:
```c#
FMODManager.Init(FMODMode.CoreAndStudio, "Content");

var sound = CoreSystem.LoadStreamedSound("test.mp3");
var channel = sound.Play();
channel.Looping = true;
```
4. Compile and hope that you (and me) did everything right.

You can also check out the incluided [Demos project](/ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio.Demos). 

## Bait-and-switch

As you could notice, there are only two nugets - Desktop and Android. But what if you want to use FMOD in a netstandard library? Since there is no crossplatform core FMOD library, this becomes a problem, right? Well, yeah. First-party C# bindings are made in a way that makes it impossible to extract core API without rewriting literally everything from scratch. I am not willing to do that. So, instead we will use a little trick. 

Bait-and switch! :0

We don't have a crossplatform library. But *we can fool* the project into thinking we have one. Open up your netstandard library's `csproj` and add this:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="ChaiFoxes.FMODAudio.Desktop" Version="2.0.0.0" >
  <PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>
</PackageReference>
```

But wait, what's this? We are adding a desktop nuget into the crossplatform project? Why? 

That's the trick - we aren't actually using it! `<PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>` makes it so the nuget's dll file is not copied over to the output directory. We are only using this nuget at compile-time - and then switching it to a platform-specific version, which is installed in your platform project. 

Hacky? Yes. (:

## But what about other platforms?

I'd like to make console versions of the library - but currently I have no ability
to do so, and probably won't have for a long time. As for UWP and Apple platforms,
I just don't care about them enough. 

If you want to be a hero and expand the library with any of those platforms yourself - 
contact me and we'll figure something out. ; - )


## License and legal stuffs

This library is licensed under MPL 2.0, so you can use it and its code in any 
shenanigans you want. Free games, commercial games, anything - no payment or 
royalties required. Just leave a credit. ; - )

But the show's main star is a bit different. FMOD has its own [license](https://fmod.com/licensing#faq), 
which is much less permissive than mine. 

Demo [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ81qi90E-Y) is provided by Agrofox and FMOD team.



Also big thanque to [StinkBrigade](https://github.com/StinkBrigade) who helped a ton in adding FMOD Studio support.
